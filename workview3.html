  <p><strong>Now and Then </strong>is a photographic project exploring time, memory, and place through lomography. It 
began when I came across a collection of old photographs at the Boston Public Library. To my 
surprise, many of the locations were places I had visited myself. This sparked a connection 
between past and present.</p> 
 <p>I began collecting historical photos of places I often go, then took new photographs from the 
same angles. I printed the old images in black and white on transparent film. For the new photos, I 
used lomography—a deep blue printing process.</p> 
 <p>This choice was personal. My father is an architect, and I grew up surrounded by blueprints. To me, 
those drawings were symbols of the future—plans of what a place might become. In this work, 
lomography becomes more than just a technique. It becomes a way to imagine time: a blueprint 
where the past meets the future in the present.</p>

  <p><strong>A Path Through the Gates</strong> is a work I created to explore the possibilities of information design. This work traces three 
unfolding journeys—from my dorm to the classroom, classroom to my Boston apartment, and finally, 
across continents to my home in China. the piece reflects on the quiet role of wayfinding and 
information design—subtle and often overlooked—guides us through spaces both familiar and 
unknown.</p>
    <div class="imgbox"><img src="images/work3 (1).png"></div>
    <p><strong> Extremely Detail </strong>is an artistic project that involves directly photocopying the intricate details of 
clothing I love. Each page captures a unique aspect, preserving texture, stitching, and form with 
mechanical precision. These pages are then carefully bound into volumes by my friend Shuofei Li 
using a sewing machine. Because no two pages are the same, editing and compiling them into a 
coherent whole presents a significant challenge—both technically and conceptually.</p>

   <p><strong>A White Container</strong> </p>
   <p style="font-style: italic;"> Think of white as a container—silent, open, and generous.</p>
   <p> White accepts everything, yet in doing so, it transforms, becoming marked, no longer purely white. 
This book is an exhibition in itself, a quiet archive that gathers traces, impressions, and the 
invisible frameworks that shape artistic experience.</p>
   <p> Presented as a tactile, sculptural object, A White Container explores the material and symbolic 
qualities of whiteness. Odd-numbered pages are pure white, embossed with subtle textures and 
forms—inviting touch, revealing structure. The reverse sides provide reflections and context: why 
each work was chosen, how white is used not to erase, but to reveal.</p>
   <p> The book embraces the tension between preservation and contamination. As viewers handle its 
pages, it collects fingerprints and smudges—evidence of being seen, touched, and read. It 
becomes a record of its own exhibition, slowly shifting from container to contained.</p>
   <p> The digital version, a white-on-white website, mirrors the physical object. Together, they frame an 
exploration of the overlooked: the tactile, the structural, the invisible grids beneath design, and 
the quiet power of white as both background and protagonist.</p>
   <p><strong> A White Container </strong>is for those who see white not as emptiness, but as presence. It invites artists, 
designers, and viewers to look closer—to see what usually goes unseen.</p>
